These can be downloaded using the *same* password you get from registering for the CHIPDYNO software.\r\n\r\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\r\n| **Toolbox**                                                                               | **Version** |\r\n| [NDLUTIL](http://github.com/lawrennd/ndlutil/)                                            | 0.159       |\r\n| [NETLAB](http://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/research/groups/ncrg/resources/netlab/downloads/)     | 3.3         |\r\n\r\n#### Version 0.12\r\n\r\nRelease version with some files missing (blank files for several demSpellman scripts).\r\n\r\n\r\nResults in the Paper\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe main scripts are `demTu` and `demSpellman` which run the code on the metabolic and cell cycle data sets. The function `chipdynoTransFact` computes the posterior, gene specific, transcription factor activities for a given transcription factor. The function `chipdynoTransFactNoise` does the same thing for expression levels with associated noise (such as computed by mmgMOS). The function `chipdynoGeneAct` sorts the transcription factor activities for a particular gene. The function `chipdynoTransFactCorrel` normalises the correlations and presents the most correlated TFs. Some scripts have been added to recreate the further validatory experiments detailed in the [Supplementary material](supplement.pdf). Specifically,`demSpellmanp1`, `demSpellmanp2` and `demSpellmanp5` run the code on the cell cycle data set with connectivity matrix obtained using different cut-offs at p=0.001, p=0.0002 and p=0.005 respectively. `demSpellmanp1p2` and `demSpellmanp5p2` do the same thing but only use the genes and transcription factors active at p=0.0002, so that the systems have the same dimensions. The script `chipDynoCompareX` can then be used to compare the matrices of effective regulations in the different cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage updated on Fri Mar 14 17:11:24 2008\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
